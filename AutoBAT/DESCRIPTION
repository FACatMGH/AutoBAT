Description: This package is designed to perform data-driven analysis of flow cytometry data from basophil activation testing. Flow cytometry data stored as .fcs files in a directory is used in the function to derive the percentage of CD63hi basophils in each .fcs file, and output includes both a table of values and a pdf of images.
