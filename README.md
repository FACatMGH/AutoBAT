AutoBAT 
======================================================

Overview
--------
AutoBAT is a tool developed for flow cytometry analysis of basophil activation testing

-   `BATgate()` analyzes flow cytometry fcs files from basophil activation tests
-   `BATmeasures()` derives measures of basophil activation testing dose-response curves, including area-under-the-curve(AUC) and ED50

These tools were developed for use with data generated from basophil activation testing. This data is generated by stimulation with antigens to generate aa dose-response stimulation curve, and subsequent parameters for data acquisition by flow cytometry include forward scatter height and area, side scatter, CCR3 and CD63. 

For transparency of analysis, reproducibility, and high-throughput use, these tools provide a algorithm for data-driven identification of basophils and a cutoff for basophil degranulation (CD63 upregulation).  Subsequent derivation of basophil activation testing measures using BATmeasures can be used as part of a workflow or separately.

Additional information can be found in Patil, et.al., "Data-driven programmatic approach to analysis of basophil activation tests", Cytometry: Part B - Clinical Cytometry. In press.

The package is also available as a docker instance: saritapatil/autobat:1.0

Installation
------------
Currently, the most efficient installation is 
``` r
# The development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("saritaupatil/AutoBAT")
```
